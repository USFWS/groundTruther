Title: Propagate Uncertainty of Remote Sensing Patch Classifications
Version: 0.0.1.2000
Description: Provides several methods to account for positional errors when 
    spatially joining ground-truthing with remote sensing patch classifications. 
	The joined data set is used to estimate the accuracy of patch type (e.g., land 
	cover, substrate type, habitat type) classifications derived from the remote 
	sensing data. The estimated classification accuracy is then used to reclassify 
	the original patch classifications several times to account for uncertainty
	in the accuracy of the original classifications. The output of allows users to 
	the accuracy and uncertainty of patch classifications and to propagate 
	classification uncertainty in products developed from the remote sensing 
	classifications (e.g., habitat maps and suitabilitiy indicies).
